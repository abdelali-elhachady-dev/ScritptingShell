awk: This is a command in Linux that processes a file line by line. It’s used to perform operations (calculations, filtering, etc.) on each line of the file.
seen[$0]:

"seen" : is an associative array (think of it like a dictionary in Python).

"$0" : refers to the entire line that awk reads from the file.

So, "seen[$0]" : means: "Check the seen array and see if this line ($0) already existe in it .
"!seen[$0]++":

"seen[$0]": returns 0 (false) if the line hasn’t been seen before (it’s not already in seen).

The "!": (NOT operator) converts 0 to 1 (true), so it says: "Ah, this line hasn’t been seen before, so print it."

The "++" : increments seen[$0] by 1, so if the same line comes up again, seen[$0] will be 1 (true), and !seen[$0] will be 0 (false), so it won’t print it again.
Example:

Copy
line1                     
line2         ---->            in our cas we dont have {line1 line 2...} we have complet line from complet text                      
line1
line3
"The process" :

line1: seen["line1"] doesn’t exist yet, so !seen["line1"]++ → true, print line1, and increment seen["line1"] to 1.

line2: seen["line2"] doesn’t exist yet, so !seen["line2"]++ → true, print line2, and increment seen["line2"] to 1.

line1: seen["line1"] already exists (1), so !seen["line1"]++ → false, so it doesn’t print it again.

line3: seen["line3"] doesn’t exist yet, so !seen["line3"]++ → true, print line3, and increment seen["line3"] to 1.
